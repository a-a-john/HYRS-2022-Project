# Lung Cancer Prediction with Machine Learning - HYRS-2022-Project

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/USERNAME/REPO/blob/main/lung_cancer_prediction.ipynb)

This project was completed as part of the 2022 High School Youth Researcher Summer (HYRS) Program under the supervision of Ken Cheeliger and mentorship of Dr. Yuan (Shawn) Xu.  

The primary objective was to train a Machine Learning algorithm to identify when an individual has lung cancer, and to predict the likelihood of cancer given a variety of patient factors.

## Objectives
- Train a classification model to detect lung cancer presence.  
- Handle imbalanced data using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE).  
- Evaluate model performance using precision and recall, ensuring meaningful results for real-world medical applications.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Data provided by Ken Cheeliger.  
   - Applied cleaning and feature selection techniques.  

2. **Addressing Imbalance**  
   - Used SMOTE to oversample the minority class and prevent bias.  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Tested machine learning models for classification.  
   - Tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy.  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Focused on precision and recall to ensure reliable detection.  
   - High scores indicate the model generalizes well.

## Potential Applications
- Assist healthcare professionals by streamlining patient diagnosis.  
- Provide risk predictions for patients through questionnaires.  
- Serve as a foundation for future medical AI research.
